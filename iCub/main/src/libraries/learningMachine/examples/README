These examples are hidden here *on purpose*. We should not in any way
give the impression that this is the proper way to use the 
learningMachine functionality. There are learningMachine modules for 
a reason and they should be used.

Ugo Pattacini: sometimes there exist cases where the resort to the
library corresponds to commendable design: for instance, the development
of an own library that encorporates the learningMachine functionality
so that the final product is self-contained and thus it is not required
to launch the learning modules externally.
Therefore, despite the fact that the modules should cover the majority
of the user's needs, please judge with care.
